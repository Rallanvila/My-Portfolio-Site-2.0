# My Portfolio Site 2.0

This is more up-to-date site. The original "My Portfolio Site" repo was built when I was just starting. This has a more accurate reflection of my latest skills and code. I was able to make the website more funtional while reducing the lines of code in half with six more projects included in the code and building.
