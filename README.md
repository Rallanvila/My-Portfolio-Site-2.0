### My Portfolio Site 2.0

This is a more up-to-date site. The original "My Portfolio Site" repo was built when I was starting. This project has a more accurate reflection of my latest skills and technologies to simplify my workflow.

I made the website more fluid while reducing the lines of code by nearly half with EIGHT more projects added.

## Technologies used
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Sass
* Gulp
* Babel
* Json
* Webpack
